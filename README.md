## Development Insights & Technical Decisions

- **Terminal-Inspired UI Design:**  
  Inspired by extensive exposure to Linux terminals (especially from CMSC 124 & 125), a terminal-themed UI was adopted, prioritizing simplicity, readability, and a distinct aesthetic.

- **Code Reusability:**  
  Efficiently employed Dart's switch-case constructs within `StreamBuilder` widgets to dynamically render content, minimizing redundancy, and achieving a clean and maintainable codebase.

- **Firebase Integration:**  
  Utilized Firebase's querying capabilities strategically, especially for friend management and filtering users, optimizing performance and simplifying complex logic.

- **Constants Management:**  
  A centralized constants file ensures uniformity in UI elements, significantly easing management and improving consistency across the app.

## Challenges Encountered

- **Implementing User Search:**  
  Efficient user search implementation with Firebase proved challenging, exacerbated by tight deadlines and Firebase‚Äôs complex querying mechanisms.

- **User Filtering Logic:**  
  Excluding existing friends or pending requests from potential friends‚Äô lists required thoughtful database structure and careful query planning.

- **Firebase Documentation:**  
  Insufficient or ambiguous documentation for specific Flutter-Firebase interactions required extensive research and experimentation.

- **Notifications (Planned but Unimplemented):**  
  Due to time constraints and complexity, notifications weren't fully implemented, identified as a key area for future improvement.
